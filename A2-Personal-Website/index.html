    <h6>Hi there, welcome to my personal website!</h6>
    </div>
    <section>
        <p>My name is Victoria Lee and I am a third year student in SFU's School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) with an interest in web development and interface design.
        I enjoy creating user-friendly and visually appealing digital experiences, and I am interested in how design and technology work together to shape meaningful user experiences.
        </p>

        <h2> My Skills</h2>

        <h2>Images of Previous Works</h2>
        <div class="images">
            <img src="images/DDA1.png" alt="IAT 235: Final Group Project (DDA Front Page)" width="500"/>
            <img src="images/DDA2.png" alt="IAT 235: Final Group Project (DDA Designers)" width="500"/>

        </div>
        <p>These are images from my previous group project, DDA, created for IAT 235.
            Through this project, I gained experience in collaborative and interface design with a focus on clear visual communication. 
            My main role in this project was interaction design, where I designed how the user moved from each page to the next and how they navigated through the microsite as a whole.
